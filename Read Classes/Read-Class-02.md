## Reading Questions

## What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?
### Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python involves writing failing tests first, writing only the code needed to pass the test, and refactoring the code afterward. 
### This approach helps to ensure better code quality, increased productivity, faster feedback, and reduced risk of introducing bugs.

## Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?
### The purpose of the if name == 'main': statement in Python scripts is to define a block of code that will only run if the script is executed directly, and not if it is imported as a module by another script. This is useful for running tests or executing specific code when the script is run standalone.

### some use cases:
- Running a test suite: You can define a test suite within the if name == 'main': block, and it will only run when you execute the script directly.
- Running a command-line interface: If you are building a command-line tool, you can define the interface within the if name == 'main': block so that it only runs when the script is executed directly.
- Running a demonstration or example: If you are writing a tutorial or example code, you can include the example code within the if name == 'main': block so that it only runs when you execute the script directly.
- Running initialization code: You can include initialization code within the if name == 'main': block, which will only run when the script is executed directly. This can be useful for setting up a script or application.
- Running performance tests: You can include performance tests within the if name == 'main': block, which will only run when the script is executed directly. This can be useful for testing the performance of specific sections of code.

## Describe the concept of recursion in Python.
### Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until a certain condition is met. In Python, a recursive function is defined with a call to itself within the function body.

## What is the difference between Python modules and packages?
### In Python, a module is a single file that contains functions, classes, or variables that can be imported and used in another Python program.

### On the other hand, a package is a collection of one or more Python modules organized in a directory hierarchy. A package must contain an init.py file, which is executed when the package is imported, and it can also contain sub-packages and modules.
### In short, a module is a single file, while a package is a collection of modules and sub-packages organized in a directory hierarchy.
