### Steps of solving problems:

<ul>

<br>
<li><strong>Understand the problem statement:</strong><br> 
Read and analyze the problem statement thoroughly, and identify the input, output, and constraints.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Define the problem:</strong><br> 
Clearly define the problem, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts, and determine the data structures and algorithms that will be required.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Plan the solution:</strong><br>
Develop a high-level plan for solving each sub-problem, and determine the appropriate tools and techniques for implementing the solution.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Write the code:</strong><br> Implement the plan by writing the code, ensuring that it is modular, easy to understand, and well-documented.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Test the code: </strong><br>
Test the code thoroughly using a variety of inputs, including edge cases, and verify that it produces the expected output.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Debug the code:</strong><br> 
If errors are detected, use debugging tools and techniques to identify and correct them.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Optimize the code:</strong><br>
Analyze the code's performance and identify opportunities for optimization, such as reducing time and space complexity or removing redundant code.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Refactor the code:</strong><br>
Improve the code's readability, maintainability, and scalability by refactoring it as necessary.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Validate the solution:</strong><br>
Confirm that the code's output is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Document the solution:</strong><br>
Document the code thoroughly, including comments, documentation, and testing procedures, to ensure that it can be easily understood and maintained by other developers.
</li>

<br>
</ul>

#### It is also essential to practice regularly, 
#### solving programming problems requires a lot of practice. 
#### Additionally, you can seek help from online resources, books, or mentors to enhance your problem-solving skills.

### And here are some tips on how to think like a programmer:

<ul>

<br>
<li><strong>Understand the problem:</strong><br>
Before you start coding, make sure you understand the problem statement thoroughly. Break it down into smaller sub-problems if necessary, and make sure you know exactly what is expected of you.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Plan your solution:</strong><br>
Think about how you can solve the problem and what steps you need to take. Write down your plan in pseudocode or a flowchart, so you have a clear idea of what you need to do.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Divide and conquer:</strong><br>
Break the problem down into smaller parts or sub-problems, and solve each of them individually. Then combine the solutions to solve the bigger problem. This approach can make the problem more manageable and easier to solve.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Debugging:</strong><br>
Debugging is a crucial part of programming. When things go wrong, use a systematic approach to find the problem, and fix it. Use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix issues in your code.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Test your code:</strong><br>
Test your code with various inputs, including edge cases, to make sure it works as expected. Automated testing can help you catch errors and bugs quickly, and ensure that your code is working correctly.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Refactor your code:</strong><br>
Once you have a working solution, you can optimize your code by refactoring it. This involves making your code more efficient, readable, and maintainable. Use best practices and design patterns to improve the quality of your code.</li>

<br>
<li><strong>Learn from your mistakes:</strong><br>
If you encounter errors or bugs, don't get discouraged. Instead, learn from your mistakes, and use that knowledge to improve your problem-solving skills. Refine your approach and try different solutions until you find the best one. Always strive to improve and learn from your experiences.</li>

<br>
</ul>

#### Remember, 
#### problem-solving is a skill that can be developed and improved with practice. 
#### Keep practicing to become a better programmer over time.

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
<br>

#### As a software engineer, you can differentiate yourself by highlighting your expertise, technical skills, and ability to solve complex problems creatively. You might also bring unique perspectives, experiences, and soft skills that can add value to a potential employer, such as communication, collaboration, and leadership abilities.


#### For example, you might have extensive experience in a specific programming language or technology stack, a passion for a particular software application, or a background in a related field, such as mathematics or physics, that enhances your problem-solving abilities.


#### It's important to showcase your strengths and unique qualities in your resume, cover letter, and job interviews to demonstrate why you're the best candidate for the job.

### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
<br>

#### When you get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature, it can be frustrating and demotivating. 

#### Here are three things you can start doing to "un-stick" yourself and get back on track:

- <strong>Take a break:</strong><br>
Sometimes, the best thing you can do is step away from the problem and take a break. This can help clear your mind and give you a fresh perspective when you return to the task. Go for a walk, grab a snack, or do something else entirely to take your mind off the problem.

- <strong>Break the problem down into smaller parts:</strong><br>
When you're faced with a complex problem, it can be helpful to break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This can help you identify specific areas where you're getting stuck and make it easier to solve the problem one step at a time. Try to isolate the part of the code or logic that's giving you trouble and focus on that.

- <strong>Ask for help:</strong><br>
It's okay to ask for help when you're stuck. 
Reach out to a colleague, mentor, or online community for advice or guidance. Sometimes, a fresh perspective or a new approach can make all the difference. Explain the problem you're facing and what you've tried so far. Don't be afraid to ask questions and seek feedback.
