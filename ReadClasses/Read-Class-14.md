### What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

#### Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh are all popular Python libraries for data visualization, but they have distinct features and use cases. Here's a comparison of their key differences:

- Matplotlib:
    - Matplotlib is a powerful and versatile library for creating static, publication-quality plots.
    - It provides a low-level interface and gives you fine-grained control over every aspect of your plot.
    - Matplotlib is widely used for creating a wide range of plots, from basic line plots and scatter plots to complex visualizations.
    - It is suitable for generating plots for scientific research, data analysis, and data presentation.
    - Example: Creating a line plot with Matplotlib to visualize the trend of stock prices over time.

<br>

- Seaborn:
    - Seaborn is a high-level library built on top of Matplotlib, focusing on creating visually appealing statistical graphics.
    - It provides a simplified API and offers default themes and color palettes, making it easy to create aesthetically pleasing plots.
    - Seaborn includes functions for visualizing distributions, relationships between variables, categorical data, and more.
    - It is suitable for exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and communicating insights.
    - Example: Creating a violin plot with Seaborn to compare the distribution of a variable across different categories.

<br>

- Bokeh:
    - Bokeh is designed for creating interactive, web-based visualizations and data applications.
    - It generates JavaScript-based plots that can be displayed in modern web browsers.
    - Bokeh focuses on providing an interactive user experience with features like zooming, panning, and hovering.
    - It is suitable for building interactive dashboards, data exploration tools, and web-based applications.
    - Example: Creating an interactive scatter plot with Bokeh that allows users to explore and interact with the data by zooming, panning, and hovering.

<br>

#### In summary, Matplotlib is a comprehensive plotting library for creating static plots, Seaborn simplifies the creation of attractive statistical graphics, and Bokeh specializes in interactive web-based visualizations. The choice of library depends on your specific requirements, whether you need static or interactive plots, and the nature of your data visualization task.

### In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

#### In Seaborn, there are several main functions for creating different types of plots:

- Relational plots:
    - scatterplot(): This function creates a scatter plot, which displays the relationship between two numerical variables.
    - lineplot(): It creates a line plot, useful for visualizing trends or patterns in data over time or any ordered variable.
    - Example use case: You can use a scatter plot to examine the relationship between a car's horsepower and its miles per gallon (MPG). Alternatively, a line plot can show the stock prices of a company over a specific time period.

<br>

- Categorical plots:
    - barplot(): It creates a bar plot, which represents the distribution of a categorical variable with rectangular bars.
    - countplot(): This function shows the count of occurrences of each category in a categorical variable using bars.
    - boxplot(): It generates a box plot, which displays the summary statistics of a numerical variable across different categories.
    - Example use case: You can use a bar plot to compare the average sales of different products in a store. A count plot can be used to show the frequency of different eye colors in a survey dataset. A box plot can illustrate the distribution of house prices across different neighborhoods.

<br>

- Distribution plots:
    - histplot(): This function creates a histogram, which represents the distribution of a numerical variable using bars.
    - kdeplot(): It generates a kernel density estimate (KDE) plot, which shows the smoothed estimate of the distribution of a variable.
    - rugplot(): It adds small vertical lines to a plot to represent individual data points along an axis.
    - Example use case: You can use a histogram to visualize the distribution of heights in a population. A KDE plot can show the estimated probability density function of test scores. A rug plot can be added to a KDE plot to indicate the actual data points.

<br>

#### These are just a few examples of the functions available in Seaborn for creating relational, categorical, and distribution plots. Seaborn provides a wide range of customization options and additional functions to cater to various visualization needs and effectively communicate insights from your data.
