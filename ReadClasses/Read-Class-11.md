### NumPy Tutorial


#### Step 1: Installing NumPy
##### Before you can use NumPy, you need to install it. You can install NumPy using pip, the package installer for Python. Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:
```
pip install numpy
```

#### Step 2: Importing NumPy
##### Once NumPy is installed, you can import it in your Python script using the following line:
```
import numpy as np
```

#### Step 3: Creating NumPy Arrays
##### NumPy arrays, or ndarray objects, are the primary data structure provided by NumPy. You can create arrays in several ways:

- From a Python list:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_array = np.array(my_list)
```

- Using NumPy functions:
```
# Create an array of zeros
zeros_array = np.zeros(5)

# Create an array of ones
ones_array = np.ones((3, 4))  # 3 rows, 4 columns

# Create an array of random numbers
random_array = np.random.rand(2, 2)  # 2x2 random array
```

#### Step 4: Array Indexing and Slicing
##### You can access and modify elements of a NumPy array using indexing and slicing:
```
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Accessing elements
print(my_array[0])  # 1
print(my_array[2:4])  # [3, 4]

# Modifying elements
my_array[1] = 10
```

#### Step 5: Array Operations
##### NumPy allows you to perform mathematical operations on arrays in an element-wise manner:
```
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Element-wise addition
result = array1 + array2  # [5, 7, 9]

# Element-wise multiplication
result = array1 * array2  # [4, 10, 18]
```


#### Step 6: Broadcasting
##### NumPy automatically broadcasts arrays of different shapes to perform operations:
```
array1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
array2 = np.array([10, 20, 30])

# Broadcasting the second array
result = array1 + array2  # [[11, 22, 33], [14, 25, 36]]
```

#### Step 7: Additional NumPy Functions
##### NumPy provides a wide range of functions for mathematical computations. Here are a few examples:
```
# Statistical functions
mean = np.mean(my_array)
std_dev = np.std(my_array)

# Linear algebra functions
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
transpose = np.transpose(matrix)
determinant = np.linalg.det(matrix)
```
<br>

#### This tutorial covers only the basics of NumPy. There are many more advanced features and functions available in the library. To explore further, I recommend referring to the official [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/), which provides detailed explanations and examples.

### Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.

#### NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library in Python used for numerical computations. It provides a multidimensional array object called ndarray, which is the fundamental building block for most scientific computing tasks. The ndarray allows efficient storage and manipulation of large arrays of homogeneous data types.

#### Here are the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays:

- Shape: 
#####  NumPy arrays are homogeneous and have a fixed size specified at the time of creation. The shape of an array refers to its dimensions, such as the number of rows and columns for a 2D array or the number of elements for a 1D array. The shape is represented as a tuple of integers.

- Data Type: 
##### Every element in a NumPy array has the same data type, which is determined at the time of creation. The data types can be numeric (integers, floats), booleans, strings, etc. Specifying a specific data type allows for efficient memory allocation and optimized mathematical operations.

- Indexing: 
##### NumPy arrays support indexing and slicing operations, similar to Python lists. Elements in an array can be accessed using square brackets [] and indices. Slicing allows you to extract portions of an array by specifying a range of indices.

- Vectorized Operations: 
##### NumPy arrays are designed to perform element-wise operations efficiently. This means that operations on arrays are automatically applied to each element of the array, resulting in concise and optimized code.



#### Now, let's see some examples of creating, manipulating, and performing operations on NumPy arrays:

1. Creating NumPy Arrays:

```
import numpy as np

# Creating a 1D array
arr1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr1d)
# Output: [1 2 3 4 5]

# Creating a 2D array
arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(arr2d)
# Output:
# [[1 2 3]
#  [4 5 6]]

# Creating an array of zeros
zeros = np.zeros((3, 4))
print(zeros)
# Output:
# [[0. 0. 0. 0.]
#  [0. 0. 0. 0.]
#  [0. 0. 0. 0.]]

# Creating an array of ones
ones = np.ones((2, 3))
print(ones)
# Output:
# [[1. 1. 1.]
#  [1. 1. 1.]]

# Creating an array of random values
random = np.random.rand(2, 2)
print(random)
# Output:

arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
concatenated = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2))
print(concatenated)
# Output: [1 2 3 4 5 6]

# Stacking arrays vertically
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
stacked = np.vstack((arr1, arr2))
print(stacked)

#  [4 5 6]]

# Stacking arrays horizontally
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
stacked = np.hstack((arr1, arr2))
print(stacked)
# Output: [1 2 3 4 5 6]

# Splitting an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
split = np.split(arr, 3)
print(split)
# Output: [array([1, 2]), array([3, 4]), array([5, 6])]

# Adding a new dimension to an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
new_dim = arr[:, np.newaxis]
print(new_dim)
# Output:
# [[1]
#  [2]
#  [3]
#  [4]
#  [5]
#  [6]]
```

3. Array Operations:

arr2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
matrix_product = np.dot(arr1, arr2)
print(matrix_product)
# Output:
# [[19 22]
#  [43 50]]

# Mathematical functions
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
mean = np.mean(arr)
print(mean)
# Output: 3.0

std_dev = np.std(arr)
print(std_dev)
# Output: 1.4142135623730951

max_value = np.max(arr)
print(max_value)
# Output: 5

# Boolean operations
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
greater_than_3 = arr > 3
print(greater_than_3)
# Output: [False False False  True  True]
```
