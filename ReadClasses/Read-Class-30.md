### Hash Tables
<br>

#### A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that provides efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations. It is based on the concept of hashing, which involves mapping keys to positions in an array called a hash table.

<br>

#### Here's how a hash table works:

- Hash Function: 
    ##### A hash function takes a key as input and produces a hash code, which is an integer value. The hash code is used to determine the position or index in the hash table where the key-value pair will be stored.

<br>

- Index Calculation: 
    ##### Using the hash code generated by the hash function, the index of the hash table is calculated. This index represents the position where the key-value pair will be stored/retrieved.

<br>

- Collision Handling: 
    ##### It's possible that two different keys produce the same hash code, leading to a collision. Collisions can occur due to the finite size of the hash table and the infinite number of possible keys. There are several techniques to handle collisions, such as:

    - Chaining: 
        ##### Each position in the hash table is a linked list. Colliding key-value pairs are stored in the same position by appending them to the linked list.

    - Open Addressing: 
        ##### In this approach, if a collision occurs, the algorithm looks for the next available position in the hash table (using a probing sequence) and stores the key-value pair there.

<br>

- Insertion: 
    ##### To insert a key-value pair into a hash table, the key is hashed to calculate the index, and collision handling is applied if necessary. The key-value pair is then stored at the determined index.

<br>

- Retrieval: 
    ##### To retrieve a value associated with a given key, the key is hashed to find the index, and the value is retrieved from that index. If collisions occurred and chaining was used, a linear search is performed in the linked list to find the key-value pair.

<br>

- Deletion: 
    ##### To delete a key-value pair, the key is hashed to determine the index, and the corresponding element is removed from the hash table. If chaining is used, the linked list is traversed to find and remove the key-value pair.

<br>

#### Hash tables are widely used due to their efficiency in providing constant-time average-case complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations, assuming a well-distributed hash function. However, their performance can degrade in the worst-case scenario if there are many collisions or if the hash function has poor distribution characteristics.

#### It's worth noting that different programming languages and libraries may provide hash table implementations with varying features and optimizations.
