### Linked Lists
<br>

#### A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. In a singly linked list, each node only has a reference to the next node, while in a doubly linked list, each node has references to both the next and previous nodes in the list.
<br>

#### Linked lists can be useful for implementing data structures such as stacks, queues, and hash tables. They can also be used for dynamic memory allocation, where new nodes can be added or removed from the list at runtime.
<br>

#### One advantage of linked lists over arrays is that they can be resized easily, as new nodes can be added or removed without needing to move the entire list in memory. However, linked lists typically have slower access times than arrays, as finding a particular node in the list may require traversing the entire list.
<br>

#### Common operations on linked lists include inserting a node at the beginning or end of the list, deleting a node from the list, and searching for a node with a specific value.
