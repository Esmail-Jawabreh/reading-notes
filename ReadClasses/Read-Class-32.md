### Permissions & Postgresql
<br>

### What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?
<br>

#### Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions are a crucial part of securing an API built with Django and DRF. They provide a way to control access to different resources and actions within the API based on the authentication and authorization of the requesting user. The key components of DRF permissions are:
<br>

- Authentication: 
    ##### This component deals with identifying the user making the request. DRF provides various authentication classes such as token authentication, session authentication, and OAuth authentication. These authentication classes verify the user's identity and set the request.user attribute, allowing you to access the authenticated user in your views or serializers.

<br>

- Authorization: 
    ##### Authorization determines whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action on a resource. DRF provides different authorization classes such as IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, AllowAny, and DjangoModelPermissions, among others. These classes define the permission requirements for different views or actions within your API.

<br>

- Permissions: 
    ##### Permissions in DRF are rules that define whether a user is allowed to perform certain actions on a particular resource. DRF offers various permission classes, including IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, AllowAny, IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly, and DjangoModelPermissions, among others. You can use these classes to define the desired level of access control for different views or actions within your API.

<br>

#### The purpose of using DRF permissions is to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access and modify the API resources. By using authentication, you can verify the identity of the user making the request. Authorization allows you to define the necessary permissions for different actions, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources. Permissions, on the other hand, allow you to fine-tune the access control based on specific requirements, such as user roles or object-level permissions.

#### By leveraging these components, DRF permissions help secure an API by preventing unauthorized access and controlling what actions authenticated users can perform. They allow you to enforce authentication and authorization rules consistently across different views and actions, ensuring that your API remains protected and only accessible to users with the appropriate permissions.

### In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?
<br>

#### In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. Its primary purpose is to query the database and retrieve specific columns or expressions from one or more tables, based on specified conditions.
<br>

#### To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', you would use the following SQL query:
```
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
<br>

#### In this query, the asterisk (*) is a wildcard symbol that represents all columns. So, by specifying SELECT *, you are instructing the database to return all columns from the 'employees' table.

### Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?
<br>

#### Django Rest Framework (DRF) Generic Views are a set of pre-built views provided by DRF that simplify the process of building RESTful APIs. These views abstract common patterns and behaviors, reducing the amount of code you need to write and promoting code reusability. The role of DRF Generic Views is to handle common CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) for resources in a standardized and consistent manner.

<br>

#### Here are a few examples of how you can use DRF Generic Views in building a RESTful API:
<br>

- ListAPIView: 
    ##### This view is used for retrieving a list of resources. It corresponds to the HTTP GET method. You can use it to fetch a collection of objects from a database and serialize them as a list. For example:
    ```
    from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView
    from .serializers import EmployeeSerializer
    from .models import Employee

    class EmployeeListAPIView(ListAPIView):
        queryset = Employee.objects.all()
        serializer_class = EmployeeSerializer
    ```

<br>

- RetrieveAPIView: 
    ##### This view is used for retrieving a single resource. It corresponds to the HTTP GET method with a specific identifier. It allows you to retrieve a single object based on its unique identifier. For example:
    ```
    from rest_framework.generics import RetrieveAPIView
    from .serializers import EmployeeSerializer
    from .models import Employee

    class EmployeeDetailAPIView(RetrieveAPIView):
        queryset = Employee.objects.all()
        serializer_class = EmployeeSerializer
    ```

<br>

- CreateAPIView: 
    ##### This view is used for creating a new resource. It corresponds to the HTTP POST method. It allows you to create a new object based on the data provided in the request. For example:
    ```
    from rest_framework.generics import CreateAPIView
    from .serializers import EmployeeSerializer

    class EmployeeCreateAPIView(CreateAPIView):
        serializer_class = EmployeeSerializer
    ```

<br>

- UpdateAPIView: 
    ##### This view is used for updating an existing resource. It corresponds to the HTTP PUT or PATCH methods with a specific identifier. It allows you to update an object based on its unique identifier and the data provided in the request. For example:
    ```
    from rest_framework.generics import UpdateAPIView
    from .serializers import EmployeeSerializer
    from .models import Employee

    class EmployeeUpdateAPIView(UpdateAPIView):
        queryset = Employee.objects.all()
        serializer_class = EmployeeSerializer
    ```

<br>

#### These are just a few examples of DRF Generic Views. DRF provides many more generic views to handle different scenarios. By utilizing these views, you can quickly and efficiently build a RESTful API by taking advantage of the pre-built functionalities while customizing the behavior as per your specific requirements.
